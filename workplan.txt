1. Environment Setup & Basic Binary Loading
    Tasks:

    Confirm you can run Binary Ninja in headless mode.
    Write a minimal script that:
    Imports the Binary Ninja API.
    Loads a binary file.
    Prints a basic property (like the binary’s length).
    Deliverable:
    A script that accepts a binary path, loads the binary, and prints its size.

2. Basic Binary Analysis – Listing Functions
    Tasks:

    Expand your script to run Binary Ninja’s analysis.
    List the functions (names and addresses) discovered in the binary.
    Verify that the output correctly shows function information.
    Deliverable:
    A script that loads a binary, waits for analysis, and prints each function’s name and starting address.

3. Integrate CAPA Engine – Running CAPA Analysis
    Tasks:

    Import CAPA modules (e.g. capa.rules and capa.main).
    Load the external CAPA rules (ensure you have the YAML rule repository on your computer).
    Write code that extracts the binary’s data and passes it (via a temporary file) to the CAPA engine.
    Print the raw CAPA analysis output.
    Deliverable:
    A script that loads the binary, extracts its data, runs CAPA analysis, and prints the resulting CAPA output.

4. Map CAPA Results to Functions and Instructions
    Tasks:

    For each CAPA match, determine which function contains the violation using Binary Ninja’s API.
    Extract the disassembled instruction at the violation address.
    Output a mapping: CAPA rule, violation address, function name (and start address), plus the instruction.
    Deliverable:
    A script that, for each CAPA violation, prints the associated function and disassembly.

5. Final Integration, Error Handling, and Logging
    Tasks:

    Combine all previous components into one cohesive script.
    Add robust error handling and logging.
    Ensure the script can run headlessly, outputting clear results (or saving to a file if desired).
    Deliverable:
    A final, integrated script that loads a binary, runs analysis, maps CAPA results to functions/instructions, and handles errors gracefully.

6. Final Testing, Documentation, and Polish
    Tasks:
    
    Test your final script on multiple sample binaries.
    Add detailed comments and documentation to your code.
    Refine logging messages and any user-facing output.
    Prepare any README or usage instructions if needed.
    Deliverable:
    A polished, well-documented project ready for deployment.
